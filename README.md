# count in rust

This project is created to learn how to code in Rust.
As my first project i want to rewrite https://github.com/dzove855/bin/blob/master/bin/count.sh in Rust.


This Tool should count files in directory based on criterias as example: exclude directories or count recursive in a specific format (DIR: count)

# TODO
* Fix multiple exclude
* Add ignore dotFiles
* Add maxdepth of recursive
